# How to Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721) with Alchemy

Developing a Smart Contract with Solidity and deploying it on the blockchain might sound daunting at first: solidity, security, gas optimization, developer environment, and gas fees, are only some of the things youâ€™ll need to go through to host your code on the blockchain.

Luckily though, in the last few months, a lot of tools have been released for developers to make their Smart contracts development jobs much easier.

Tools like the OpenZeppelin Wizard that offers developers click and write functionalities to create composable and secure smart contracts in no time, used with Web3 developer tools like Alchemy, make the experience of writing a deploying code on the blockchain easy, fast, and reliable like never before.

In this tutorial, you're going to learn how to develop and deploy an ERC721 (NFT) smart contract using Alchemy, OpenZeppelin, Remix, and Ethereum Rinkeby.

More precisely, you will learn:

* How to write and modify the smart contract using 
* OpenZeppelin and Remix
* Get free Rinkeby ETH using rinkebyfaucet.com
* Deploy it on the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet blockchain to save on gas fees
* Host the NFT tokens metadata on IPFS using Filebase.
* Mint an NFT and visualize it on OpenSea
